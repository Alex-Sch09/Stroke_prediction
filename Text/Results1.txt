All trained models were ranked using their mean roc_auc score. With this criterion, the best 
performing model was a CatBoost model using one hundred iterations with a depth of three levels, which 
achieved a mean roc_auc score of 0.851 with a standard deviation of 0.048 (see table below). The independent variables with the 
highest predictive value, as explained using shap, were _Age_, _Average_glucose_level_, _Ever_married_Yes_,
_Hypertension_, and _BMI_.
