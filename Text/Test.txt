The test set obtained from the preprocessed dataset was used to evaluate the prediction ability
of the trained model. The values corresponding to the independent variables in the test set were used to predict 
the occurence of strokes and the results were compared to the actual stroke occurrence data. The trained 
CatBoost model achieved a roc_auc score of 0.754 and a recall_score of 0.790 in this prediction.
