Gridsearch was used to train various models, tuning their main hyperparameters over a range of values. The following models were
trained, using the listed ranges for hyperparameter tuning and the listed models for RFE:  
                
**RandomForestClassifier:**  
                Number of estimators: 50 to 400 with a step of 50.  
                Max depth of estimators: [3, 5, 7]  
                
**CatBoostClassifier**:  
                Number of iterations: 50 to 400 with a step of 50.  
                Max depth of iterations: [3, 5, 7]  
                
**DecisionTreeClassifier**:  
                Max leaf nodes: 2 to 50 with a step of 5.  
                Max depth: 1 to 7.  
        
**LogisticRegression**:  
                All hyperparameters were set to default.

**XGBClassifier**:  
                Number of estimators: 50 to 400 with a step of 50.  
                Max depth of estimators: [3, 5, 7]  
                
GridSearch was performed with five-fold stratified crossvalidation using the area under the ROC curve (roc_auc score) as the evaluation metric.
