The following steps were executed to preprocess the data:
- Deletion of irrelevant variables: Colum ID was deleted because it provided no useful information for the analysis.
- Categorical variable encoding: OneHotEncoder was used for encoding categorical variables. ColumnTransformer 
was used to ensure only categorical variables were encoded. This process resulted in the creation of one
column for each value of each categorical variable. One of these columns was deleted for each
variable to avoid perfect correlation between the new variables.
- Imputation of missing values: KNN imputer was used to fill missing values using a Nearest Neighbour
criterion.
- Outlier deletion: during preliminary analysis, extreme BMI values were idenfied, possibly due to data-loading errors.
In order to avoid an excessive data deletion, a BMI threshold of 70 was established. All records with BMI values exceding 
this threshold were deleted from the data set.
- Continuous variable normalization: continuous variables were normalized using MinMaxScaler to
prevent larger-scale continuous variables from dominating the predictive ability of the trained model. ColunmTransformer
was used to execute normalization on continuous variables only.
- Data resampling: the unbalance in the outcome variable was compensated through undersampling using the imblearn
library. To avoid data leakage, resampling was performed after splitting the data into train and test sets.
